*************************************************V1 Notes************************************************
Code Architecture
- Single file structure: All functionality contained in one main file (~1000+ lines)
- Mixed framework usage: Combines tkinter and customtkinter libraries
- Global variable dependency: Uses global state for user management and data sharing
- Procedural programming approach: Functions handle UI creation and database operations

Database Implementation
- SQLite integration: Uses local SQLite database for user data storage
- Direct SQL operations: Database queries executed without wrapper functions
- Connection management: Opens/closes connections per operation
- Schema structure: Single users table with embedded daily tracking fields
- Data types: Uses INTEGER fields for weights and personal records

User Interface Design
- CustomTkinter framework: Modern UI components with dark theme
- Fixed positioning: Uses .place() for precise widget positioning
- Multi-page navigation: Page switching through pack_forget/pack system
- Particle background effect: GitHub-sourced particle animation system
- Frame-based layout: Separate frames for each major section

Security Implementation
- Plain text storage: Passwords stored without encryption
- Basic authentication: Simple username/password verification
- Security questions: Password recovery through security Q&A
- No session tokens: Direct global variable for current user state

Performance Characteristics
- Particle system: 100 moving particles with continuous animation
- Image loading: PIL/ImageTk for thumbnail and icon display
- Widget recreation: Destroys and recreates widgets on page switches
- Background music: Pygame integration for soundtrack playback
- Fixed window size: 1400x800 pixel window with centered positioning

Error Handling Approach
- Basic validation: Limited input checking for registration
- CTkMessagebox alerts: User notifications for login/registration outcomes
- Exception assumptions: Assumes successful file operations and database connections
- Graceful degradation: Limited fallback mechanisms for missing resources

Data Management
- Embedded food database: 25 hardcoded food items with nutrition data
- Daily reset logic: Date-based calorie intake reset functionality
- Direct database updates: Individual SQL updates for each data modification
- User preference storage: Daily limits and personal records in user table

Code Organization
- Function-based structure: Individual functions for major operations
- Inline event handlers: Lambda functions for button commands
- Mixed styling approaches: Hardcoded colors, fonts, and dimensions throughout
- Resource dependencies: External image and audio file requirements

Navigation System
- Page switching function: Central switch_page() with frame management
- Button positioning: Fixed sidebar navigation with lift() operations
- State management: Frame visibility control through pack/pack_forget
- Multi-level navigation: Sub-sections within major pages (nutrition, etc.)

External Dependencies
- Custom libraries: CTkMessagebox, CTkScrollableDropdown, CTkXYFrame
- Image processing: PIL for image manipulation and display
- Audio system: Pygame for background music functionality
- Windows styling: pywinstyles for opacity effects
- Web integration: webbrowser module for external links

Current Implementation Status
- Functional core features: Login, registration, workout videos, meal tracking
- Working database operations: User creation, data updates, retrieval
- Active UI components: All major sections implemented and accessible
- Media integration: Images, music, and external video links functional
- Cross-section functionality: Data flows between nutrition, progress, and settings

**************************************************V2 Notes************************************************
Database Error Handling
- Added comprehensive try-catch blocks for all database operations
- Implemented proper connection closing in finally blocks
- Added transaction safety with commit/rollback handling
- Enhanced field types (INTEGER to REAL for weights/PRs to allow decimals)

- Input Validation & Security
- Added password masking (show="*") to all password entry fields
- Implemented comprehensive input validation for usernames, passwords, and numeric values
- Added constants for validation limits (MIN_PASSWORD_LENGTH, MAX_WEIGHT, MAX_PR)
- Input sanitization with whitespace stripping
- SQL injection prevention using parameterized queries consistently

Performance Improvements
- Reduced particle count from 100 to 50 for better performance
